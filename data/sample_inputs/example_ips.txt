# Example IP Addresses and Ranges for Nmap Parallel Scanner
# Lines starting with # will be treated as hostnames by Nmap
# if not filtered by an input processing function.
# Our current ip_handler.read_ips_from_file does not filter them.
# For a "clean" functional example, ensure only valid targets are listed without leading comments.
# This example file is intended to be clean for direct use.

# Publicly scannable host (Nmap's test site)
scanme.nmap.org

# Google's Public DNS Servers
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4

# A small CIDR range
# Using scanme.nmap.org's /30 block for demonstration.
# (45.33.32.156, 45.33.32.157, 45.33.32.158, 45.33.32.159)
45.33.32.156/30

# Hyphenated range (using a small part of Google's DNS range for safety)
8.8.8.1-8.8.8.3
