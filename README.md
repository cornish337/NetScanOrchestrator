# NetScan Orchestrator

NetScan Orchestrator is a Python-based framework for managing and executing Nmap scans against a large number of targets. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) to ingest targets, plan scan runs, and execute them in parallel, with all metadata and results stored in a local SQLite database.

## Features

- **Database-Driven Workflow:** Manages targets, scan runs, batches, and results in a SQLite database for persistent state.
- **Parallel Scanning:** Executes Nmap scans concurrently to efficiently scan large numbers of targets.
- **Command-Line Interface:** A powerful CLI (built with Typer) provides a structured workflow for managing scans.
- **Flexible Target Input:** Reads IP addresses, CIDR notations, and hyphenated ranges from a text file.
- **Status Reporting:** The CLI can provide summaries of scan runs, including failed jobs and the slowest-running jobs.

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured as a Python package with the following key components:

- **CLI (`src/cli/main.py`):** The main entry point for the `netscan` command, orchestrating the entire workflow.
- **Database Layer (`src/db/`):** SQLAlchemy models and a repository pattern for all database interactions.
- **Core Logic (`src/`):** Modules for handling IP addresses, running Nmap scans, and generating reports.
- **Web UI (`web_ui/`):** A simple Flask-based web interface. **Note:** This component is not fully integrated with the current database-driven workflow and may not be functional.

For more details on the modules, see the [Module Overview](docs/MODULES.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Nmap

### Installation

For detailed instructions on how to set up your environment and install the package, please see the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

In summary, you will need to:
1.  Set up a Python virtual environment.
2.  Install the package using `pip install .`.

### Usage

Once installed, the `netscan` command will be available. The general workflow is:
1.  `netscan ingest <your_ip_file.txt>`
2.  `netscan plan`
3.  `netscan split <scan_run_id>`
4.  `netscan run <scan_run_id>`
5.  `netscan status`

For a detailed walkthrough with examples, please see the [Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md).

### Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to run the Flask web UI inside a container. It maps the repository's `data/` directory to `/app/data` in the container, ensuring all scan outputs are written to a persistent location. To build the image and start the service, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000. Scan output files generated by the web UI or CLI will appear in your local `data/` directory (for example, JSON results are saved under `data/cli_outputs/`).
